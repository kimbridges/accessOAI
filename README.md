# accessOAI
Functions for R that use the OpenAI API to answer a query or analyze supplied text or an image.

The Large Language Models (LLM) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT draw on a huge body of information to answer questions.
The same LLM can be used in a more directed way to look at a specific body of words or a particular image.
The power, for an R programmer, comes when there is access to the LLM inside a chunk of code. That's the role of an API.

The functions in this package are quite simple as this is an early exploration of the utility of API access to a LLM.
